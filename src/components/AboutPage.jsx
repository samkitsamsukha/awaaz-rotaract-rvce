                <p className="">
                    Awaaz began not as a project, but as a conviction. A belief that every child,
                    regardless of circumstance, deserves access to stories that inspire, educate, and comfort.

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-sans font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Awaaz Exists</h2>
                <p>
                    In many communities, reading is not always possible—for those who are blind, visually impaired, or have never had the opportunity to become literate. While books and screens remain out of reach, voices do not. Voices travel through shared devices, through community spaces, and through the simple act of listening together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Awaaz exists to serve those who cannot rely on written words. We create meaningful audio content for the blind, the visually impaired, and those who cannot read, recording stories, lessons, and messages of hope in multiple languages in partnership with NGOs, ensuring knowledge, inspiration, and dignity are accessible to all—through sound.
                </p>
